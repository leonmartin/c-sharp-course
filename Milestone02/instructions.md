# Milestone 02: Becoming Friends with C#

Maybe you have been wondering why there wasn't any programming yet even though this is supposed to be programming crash course. Good news, the wait is over. ðŸ¥³

But, before we dive into the implementation of our banking application, we will first do some simple exercises to do our first steps in C#. The exercises are designed to specifically prepare you for the implementation of the banking app. Note that some of the exercises are derived from [Microsofts's official C# exercises](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/).

The objectives of this milestone are:

- Getting used to the C# syntax
- Learn and use basic data types and structures
- Create your first classes and objects
- Use loops and if-then-else constructs

## Task 02.1: The Basics of C# 



## Task 02.2: Implementing a CLI
