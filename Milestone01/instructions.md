# Milestone 02: Becoming Friends with C#

Good news, the wait is over. You will now write your first C# code. ðŸ¥³

But, before we dive into the conception and implementation of our banking application, we will do some simple C# exercises first. The exercises are designed to specifically prepare you for the implementation of the banking app. Note that some of the exercises are derived from [Microsofts's official C# exercises](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/).

The objectives of this milestone are:

- Getting used to the C# syntax
- Learn and use basic data types and structures
- Create your first classes and objects
- Use loops and if-then-else constructs
