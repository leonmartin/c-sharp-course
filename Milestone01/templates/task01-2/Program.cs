// Task 01.2: Loops and if-then-else Constructs

// Exercise 1
// Have a look at the following array of numbers.
// 1. Use a for each loop to iterate the array and print each number.
Console.WriteLine("\n***** Output of Task01.2 - Exercise 1 *****\n");

double[] myNumbers = { 234.5, 12.0, 34666.43, 5.9, 55.99, 213.2 };

// Exercise 2
// 1. Use a for loop to iterate the array from Exercise 1 and print each number.
Console.WriteLine("\n***** Output of Task01.2 - Exercise 2 *****\n");

// Exercise 3
// 1. Use a while loop to iterate the array from Exercise 1 and print each number.
Console.WriteLine("\n***** Output of Task01.2 - Exercise 3 *****\n");

// Exercise 4
// 1. Use a foreach loop to iterate the array from Exercise 1.
// 2. Use a if-then-else construct to only print the numbers that are less than or equal 12.
Console.WriteLine("\n***** Output of Task01.2 - Exercise 4 *****\n");

// Exercise 5
// 1. Use a foreach loop to iterate the array from Exercise 1.
// 2. Use a if-then-else construct to only sum up the numbers that are bigger than 12.
// 3. Print the resulting sum.
Console.WriteLine("\n***** Output of Task01.2 - Exercise 5 *****\n");

// Exercise 6
// 1. Use a foreach loop to iterate the array from Exercise 1.
// 2. Use a if-then-else construct to print a sentence stating that the current number is less than/equal or a sentence stating that the current number is bigger than 12.
Console.WriteLine("\n***** Output of Task01.2 - Exercise 6 *****\n");

// Exercise 7
// 1. Use a foreach loop to iterate the array from Exercise 1.
// 2. Use a if-then-else construct to print a sentence stating that the current number is less than 12, a sentence stating that the current number is bigger than 234, or a sentence stating that the current number is between 12 and 234.
Console.WriteLine("\n***** Output of Task01.2 - Exercise 7 *****\n");

// Exercise 8
// 1. Do the same as in Exercise 7 but use a switch statement for the case differentiation this time.
Console.WriteLine("\n***** Output of Task01.2 - Exercise 8 *****\n");
