// Task 01.3: Creating your own Classes and Objects

// Exercise 1
// Have a look the Calculator class in the Calculator.cs file in this folder.
// 1. Create an object by instantiating the Calculator class.
// 2. Call the Add method of the object using two double variables.
// 3. Print the result of the calculation.
Console.WriteLine("\n***** Output of Task01.3 - Exercise 1 *****\n");

// Exercise 2
// 1. Implement another method called Subtract in the Calculator class that takes two double variables as input, subtracts the second from the first one, and returns the result.
// 2. Create an object by instantiating the Calculator class.
// 3. Call the Subtract method of the object using two double variables.
// 4. Print the result of the calculation.
Console.WriteLine("\n***** Output of Task01.3 - Exercise 2 *****\n");

// Exercise 3
// 1. Add a List called PreviousResults as a property to the Calculator class.
// 2. Adjust the Add und Subtract such that the respective result is added to PreviousResults before it is returned.
// 3. Create an object by instantiating the Calculator class.
// 4. Make some calculations using the Calculator.
// 5. Use a foreach loop to iterate the PreviousResults property and print each of them.
Console.WriteLine("\n***** Output of Task01.3 - Exercise 3 *****\n");
