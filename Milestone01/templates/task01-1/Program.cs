// Exercise 1
// 1. Print a sentence on the console that states what your favorite animals are.

// Exercise 2
// 1. Store the string from Exercise 1 in a variable.
// 2. Print the variable on the console.

// Exercise 3
// 1. Store the string from Exercise 1 in a variable.
// 2. Use a string method to change every character of the variable to upper case.
// 3. Print the variable on the console afterwards.

// Exercise 4
// 1. Store the string from Exercise 1 in a variable.
// 2. Store a second sentence in another string variable.
// 3. Print both strings on the console using only one Console.WriteLine call.
// Make sure there is a space between both sentences in the output.

// Exercise 5
// 1. Store the string from Exercise 1 in a variable.
// 2. Use a string property to get the number of characters in the string.
// 3. Store the number of characters in a variable.
// 4. Print the sentence on the console and add the length of sentence in brackets behind it.

// Exercise 6
// 1. Do the same as in Exercise 5 but print the result using string interpolation now.

// Exercise 7
// In ASCII encoding, each character needs 7 bits.
// 1. Store an arbitrary sentence in a string variable.
// 2. Calculate the number of bits this string needs in ASCII encoding.
// 3. Store the number of bits in a variable.
// 4. Print the sentence on the console and add the number of bits in brackets behind it using string interpolation.

// Exercise 7
// See below the diameter of a circle as a double.
// 1. Calculate the circumference of the circle and store it in a variable.
// 2. Calculate the area of the circle and store it in a variable.
// 3. Print a sentence on the console stating the circumference and the area of the circle given the diameter.
