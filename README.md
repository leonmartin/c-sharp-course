# C# Crash Course

This small crash course provides a concise introduction to the most important aspects of the beautiful C# language for beginners. As a final task, you will implement a small Todo List App.

## Usage

Some parts of this crash course are actually pointers to some official Microsoft online tutorials that comprise a web editor for editing and running basic C# code. Therefore, no installations are required for this part. In contrast, other parts require editing and running C# code locally. We recommend installing the VSCode editor and Docker for running the C# code in a container. This way, no other binaries have to be installed.

To start the container, simply run ``docker compose run csharp`` in the terminal of VSCode. Then, navigate to the respective folder and run ``dotnet run``.
