# Milestone 04: The User Interface

Maybe you have been wondering why there wasn't any programming yet even though this is supposed to be programming crash course. Well, the wait is over. After making the concept of our application explicit using UML diagrams, we can now finally start programming. ðŸ¥³

The objectives of this milestone are:

- Getting used to the C# syntax
- Create your first C# class
- Get to know loops and if-then-else constructs

## Task 02.1: The basics of C# 

## Task 02.2: Implementing a CLI

This marks the end of the crash course! I hope you enjoyed it and learned something useful. You are now ready for the real world:
